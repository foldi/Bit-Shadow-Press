Bit-Shadow Press
======

Bit-Shadow Press is a utility that analyzes a sequence of bitmaps and outputs json formatted data for use by [Bit-Shadow Machine](https://github.com/foldi/Bit-Shadow-Machine). You can use it to create traditional frame-based animation in a web browser.

## How to use

First, create a pixel art animation using whatever tool you feel comfortable with. For best results, follow these guidelines.

* All frames should be the same size.
* Save your files in either .jpg or .png format.
* You can include transparency in .png 24-bit format.
